# Decision Tree Regression

## Description
This project implements a decision tree regression model using Python. The model predicts salaries based on position levels, utilizing a dataset that includes job positions, their corresponding levels, and salaries. It serves as an educational example to demonstrate the implementation of decision tree regression in Python.

## Installation and Setup
To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the following libraries:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn

You can install these libraries using pip:
```
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib scikit-learn
```

## Dataset Overview
The dataset used in this project is 'Position_Salaries.csv', which contains three columns:
- Position: The title of the job position.
- Level: The level of the job position.
- Salary: The annual salary for the position.

Here is a snippet of the dataset:
```
Position           Level  Salary
Business Analyst      1   45000
Junior Consultant     2   50000
...
```

## Usage
To use this project, follow these steps:
1. Load the dataset using pandas.
2. Define the feature (Level) and target variable (Salary).
3. Train the decision tree regression model using scikit-learn.
4. Predict the salary for a given level.
5. Visualize the results using matplotlib.

Each step is detailed in the Jupyter Notebook (`main.ipynb`).

## Results
The model can predict the salary for a given job level. For example, it can predict the salary for a position level of 6.5.
